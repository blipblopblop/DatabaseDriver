# DatabaseDriver
driver code for communicating with EasyDBâ„¢ in Python3. Database driver is the client software which provides an interface to database servers. The driver is in charge of sending and receiving data to and from the server, typically through TCP/IP. The data sent across the network are known as packets. I have implemented the EasyDB driver in Python3 according to the packet format specification described in the Lab1 attachment.
